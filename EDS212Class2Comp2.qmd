## Directions for Git

first type usethis::use_git()

then answer yes twice

now we can make changes and then make sure to save those changes

we now have a local git repo (we will never look at a local one, look at it through github after these next steps)

usethis::use_github()

mine says master instead of main?? is that a problem?? (in the Pushing to Github)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

```

## Plotting Functions in ggplot2

```{r}
fx = function(x) {3 * x^2 + 4}

ggplot(data.frame(x = c(1,100)), aes(x = x)) +
  geom_function(fun = fx)
```

## Partial Derivative

```{r}
#use the expression function to then take a derivative of it
#use function function to just make a function
fxyz = expression(2 * x * y + 3* (x^2) * (z^3))
dfdy = D(fxyz, 'y') #this is a partial derivative
dfdy
```
